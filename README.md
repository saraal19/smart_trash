# smart_trash
 We will be using an Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic sensor, and an LCD to create a smart trash bin that opens automatically upon detecting an obstacle using 
 the ultrasonic sensor. It will send a command to a stepper motor to open the lid.
here are the steps to create a smart trash bin that automatically opens when it detects an obstacle using an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensor, and a stepper motor:

Materials Needed:

Arduino Uno
Ultrasonic sensor (e.g.  HC-SR04)
Stepper motor (with a controller)
LCD (for displaying information)
Trash bin or a suitable container for the project
Power supply for the stepper motor (may require a driver)
Project Steps:

Hardware Setup:

Mount the stepper motor on the trash bin in a way that it can open the lid.
Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino following the appropriate wiring diagram.
Arduino Programming:

Use the Arduino IDE to program your Arduino Uno.
Utilize a library like "NewPing" to read data from the ultrasonic sensor.
Program the Arduino to continuously measure the distance between the ultrasonic sensor and an obstacle.
Reacting to Obstacle Detection:

Set a trigger distance. When the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle at this distance or less, the stepper motor should activate to open the lid.
Program the Arduino to send a signal to the stepper motor to perform an opening rotation when an obstacle is detected.
You will also need to devise a mechanism for closing the lid once the obstacle is no longer detected.
LCD Display (optional):

If you want to display information on an LCD screen, program the Arduino to show relevant messages or data, e.g., "Bin Open" or the current distance.
Testing and Adjustments:

Test your smart trash bin by placing obstacles at different distances to ensure it opens and closes correctly.
Ensure the opening and closing mechanism is reliable.
Power Supply:

Make sure the stepper motor has an appropriate power supply and is correctly connected.
Final Assembly:

Securely fasten all components, ensure they work well together, and the trash bin lid opens and closes as intended.
Usage:

Place the trash bin in a suitable location and use it as a regular bin. It will automatically open when it detects an obstacle at the defined distance.
Remember to take safety precautions when working with electrical equipment, especially concerning the power supply for the stepper motor. This project can be both fun and educational while providing a practical function.
